How to Set Up a Threat Hunting and Threat Intelligence Program,https://thehackernews.com/2023/05/how-to-set-up-threat-hunting-and-threat.html," Threat hunting is an essential component of your cybersecurity strategy. Whether you're getting started or in an advanced state, this article will help you ramp up your threat intelligence program. What is Threat Hunting? The cybersecurity industry is shifting from a reactive to a proactive approach. Instead of waiting for cybersecurity alerts and then addressing them, security organizations are now deploying red teams to actively seek out breaches, threats and risks, so they can be isolated. This is also known as ""threat hunting.""  Why is Threat Hunting Required? Threat hunting complements existing prevention and detection security controls. These controls are essential for mitigating threats. However, they are optimized for low false positive alerting. Hunt solutions, on the other hand, are optimized for low false negatives. This means that the anomalies and outliers that are considered false positives for detection solutions, are hunting solutions' leads, to b","May 08, 2023",Threat Hunting / OSINT

Why Telecoms Struggle with SaaS Security,https://thehackernews.com/2023/05/why-telecoms-struggle-with-saas-security.html," The telecom industry has always been a tantalizing target for cybercriminals. The combination of interconnected networks, customer data, and sensitive information allows cybercriminals to inflict maximum damage through minimal effort. It's the breaches in telecom companies that tend to have a seismic impact and far-reaching implications — in addition to reputational damage, which can be difficult to measure, telecoms are often at the receiving end of government fines for their cybersecurity and privacy failures. There are few industries in the world that collect as much sensitive data as telecom companies. In recent years, telecom companies have accelerated their digital transformation, shedding legacy systems and reducing costs. These changes, coupled with the need for stronger collaboration with third-party vendors, have led them to SaaS applications to handle their CRM. Today, telecoms are using SaaS apps for billing, HR, call management, field operations management, tracking ca","May 02, 2023",SaaS Security

New Decoy Dog Malware Toolkit Uncovered: Targeting Enterprise Networks,https://thehackernews.com/2023/05/new-decoy-dog-malware-toolkit-uncovered.html," An analysis of over 70 billion DNS records has led to the discovery of a new sophisticated malware toolkit dubbed  Decoy Dog  targeting enterprise networks. Decoy Dog , as the name implies, is evasive and employs techniques like strategic domain aging and DNS query dribbling, wherein a series of queries are transmitted to the command-and-control (C2) domains so as to not arouse any suspicion. ""Decoy Dog is a cohesive toolkit with a number of highly unusual characteristics that make it uniquely identifiable, particularly when examining its domains on a DNS level,"" Infoblox  said  in an advisory published late last month. The cybersecurity firm, which identified the malware in early April 2023 following anomalous DNS beaconing activity, said its atypical characteristics allowed it to map additional domains that are part of the attack infrastructure.

Wanted Dead or Alive: Real-Time Protection Against Lateral Movement,https://thehackernews.com/2023/05/wanted-dead-or-alive-real-time.html," Just a few short years ago, lateral movement was a tactic confined to top APT cybercrime organizations and nation-state operators. Today, however, it has become a commoditized tool, well within the skillset of any ransomware threat actor. This makes real-time detection and prevention of lateral movement a necessity to organizations of all sizes and across all industries. But the disturbing truth is that there is actually no tool in the current security stack that can provide this real-time protection, creating what is arguably the most critical security weakness in an organization's security architecture.  In this article, we'll walk through the most essentials questions around the challenge of lateral movement protection, understand why multifactor authentication (MFA) and service account protection are the gaps that make it possible, and learn how Silverfort's platform turns the tables on attackers and makes lateral movement protection finally within reach.

Malverposting refers to the use of promoted social media posts on services like Facebook and Twitter to mass propagate malicious software and other security threats. The idea is to reach a broader audience by paying for ads to ""amplify"" their posts. According to  Guardio Labs , such attacks commence with the adversary creating new business profiles and hijacking already popular accounts to serve ads that claim to offer free adult-rated photo album downloads. Within these ZIP archive files are purported images that are actually executable files, which, when clicked, activate the infection chain and ultimately deploy the stealer malware to siphon session cookies, account data, and other information.

Why Your Detection-First Security Approach Isn't Working,https://thehackernews.com/2023/04/why-your-detection-first-security.html," Stopping new and evasive threats is one of the greatest challenges in cybersecurity. This is among the biggest reasons why  attacks increased dramatically in the past year  yet again, despite the estimated $172 billion spent on global cybersecurity in 2022. Armed with cloud-based tools and backed by sophisticated affiliate networks, threat actors can develop new and evasive malware more quickly than organizations can update their protections.  Relying on malware signatures and blocklists against these rapidly changing attacks has become futile. As a result, the SOC toolkit now largely revolves around threat detection and investigation. If an attacker can bypass your initial blocks, you expect your tools to pick them up at some point in the attack chain. Every organization's digital architecture is now seeded with security controls that log anything potentially malicious. Security analysts pore through these logs and determine what to investigate further. Does this work? Let'","Apr 28, 2023",Endpoint Detection and Response
